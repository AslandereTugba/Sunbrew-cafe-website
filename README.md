## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `sunbrew/index.html` in a browser.

**Recommended:** run with a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) to avoid path issues.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
GitHub Pages serves files from the repository root (or `/docs`).  
To publish this site, use one of these options:

**Option A (simplest):** move everything inside `sunbrew/` to the repository root and enable Pages from `/ (root)`.

**Option B (clean):** rename `sunbrew/` to `docs/` and enable Pages from `/docs`.

## Notes
- The gallery page is named `gallary.html`. If you rename it to `gallery.html`, update all navbar links accordingly.
- The contact form is UI-only (no backend submission).
